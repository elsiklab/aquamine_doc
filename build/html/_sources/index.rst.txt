AquaMine v1.1 Documentation
==================================================

**AquaMine** is a data mining resource that integrates genomic data of importance to U.S. aquaculture. It combines data generated by the aquaculture research community with data from external public databases. Many customized bioinformatics tools are available that researchers with or without bioinformatic programming skills can use to create their own crafted datasets for use in their research projects. AquaMine is powered by `InterMine <http://intermine.org>`_, an open-source data warehousing system that provides access to a wide variety of datasets.
